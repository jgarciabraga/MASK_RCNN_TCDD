# MASK_RCNN_TCDD
In this project I am using the Mask R-CNN (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) to perform Tree Crown Detection and Delineation (TCDD) in a tropical forest region.

First, install all dependencies follwing the instructions in the web page https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.

Install the GDAL

Then, make the download of my packge.

I only made some code modifications to able the Mask R-CNN works with TIF images and shape files

You can use this to delineate tree crowns in other regions or to detect some tree specie.

Here you find the trained weights of my Mask R-CNN and an example present in the article.

Download the images with examples need to create the synthetic images
